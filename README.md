You will design a machine that can compute the multiplication of two numbers without using multiplier. Your machine takes two 16-bit numbers and compute the multiplication result of these two numbers. It has two blocks:

<ol>

 <li>Control Unit: Has the FSM inside.</li>

 <li>Datapath: Has all required components like adders, registers, multiplexers and etc.</li>

</ol>

You will actually implement the following C code with your machine. <strong>mult = 0; while( a &gt; 0 ){ mult = mult + b; a = a â€“ 1; </strong>

<strong>}</strong>

Use registers for a, b and mult. Use one adder for addition and subtraction.

BONUS:

If you can also perform negative number multiplications you get extra credit. (25pts)

<ol>

 <li>Decide states and draw the state diagram for your FSM controller.</li>

 <li>Draw datapath.</li>

 <li>Draw truth table.</li>

 <li>Derive Boolean expressions from the truth table.</li>

 <li>Draw the circuit on Logisim.</li>

 <li>Simulate and see whether it works. If it does not turn back to previous stages and check each carefully.</li>

 <li>You get low credits if it does not execute in Logisim.</li>

 <li>Submit your report including all the above stages (from 1 to 5) to the given submission link. Also submit your Logisim .circ file. Please indicate which parts of the project work and which ones do not precisely in your report.</li>

 <li>It is not a group project. Cheating results in -100.</li>
